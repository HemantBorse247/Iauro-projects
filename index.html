                <p>
                    ChatGPT, which stands for Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, is a chatbot developed by OpenAI.
                    ChatGPT is built on top of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 family of large language models, and is fine-tuned with
                    both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ChatGPT was launched as a prototype in November 2022, and quickly garnered attention for its
                    detailed responses and articulate answers across many domains of knowledge. Its uneven factual
                    accuracy was identified as a significant drawback.

                <p>
                    ChatGPT was fine-tuned on top of GPT-3.5 using supervised learning as well as reinforcement
                    learning. Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's performance. In the case of
                    supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played both
                    sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement step, human trainers first ranked
                    responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create
                    'reward models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy
                    Optimization (PPO). Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit
                    to trust region policy optimization algorithms; they negate many of the computationally expensive
                    operations with faster performance. The models were trained in collaboration with Microsoft on
                    their Azure supercomputing infrastructure.

                <p>
                    In comparison to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful
                    responses; in one example, while InstructGPT accepts the prompt "Tell me about when Christopher
                    Columbus came to the US in 2015" as truthful, ChatGPT uses information about Columbus' voyages and
                    information about the modern world including perceptions of Columbus to construct an answer that
                    assumes what would happen if Columbus came to the U.S. in 2015. ChatGPT's training data includes
                    man pages and information about Internet phenomena and programming languages, such as bulletin board
                    systems and the Python programming language.
